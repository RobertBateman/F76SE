# sfe
SFE is a project wholly based on F4SE, which can be found at https://f4se.silverlock.org/.
The purpose of SFE is to enable F4SE's Scaleform hook functionality to extend mod features in Fallout 76, currently to be used in Text Chat, Perk Loadout Manager, and Save Everything.
This is NOT in any way a replacement for F4SE.

Acknowledgments:
- The F4SE team for making this possible and permitting its use in the project.
- Reg2k for his very helpful DXGI shim (https://github.com/reg2k).

TODO:
- Clean up all unused code that is not Scaleform-specific.
